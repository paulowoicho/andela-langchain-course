            "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n",

The Transformer is more parallelizable and requires less training time. The paper also discusses the advantages of self-attention and describes the architecture of the Transformer, including the encoder and decoder stacks and the attention mechanism used. The paper further compares self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers in terms of computational complexity, parallelizability, and the length of paths between long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, the paper explores the interpretability of self-attention and presents examples of attention distributions related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. The training regime, hardware, schedule, optimizer, and regularization techniques used for training the models are described. The paper also presents the results of machine translation tasks, where the Transformer outperforms previous models in terms of BLEU scores while requiring significantly less training cost. The importance of different components of the Transformer is evaluated, and the model's generalization to English constituency parsing is demonstrated.\n",

The Transformer is more parallelizable and requires less training time. The paper also discusses the advantages of self-attention and describes the architecture of the Transformer, including the encoder and decoder stacks and the attention mechanism used. The paper further compares self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers in terms of computational complexity, parallelizability, and the length of paths between long-range dependencies in the network. Additionally, the paper explores the interpretability of self-attention and presents examples of attention distributions related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. The training regime, hardware, schedule, optimizer, and regularization techniques used for training the models are described. The paper also presents the results of machine translation tasks, where the Transformer outperforms previous models in terms of BLEU scores while requiring significantly less training cost. The importance of different components of the Transformer is evaluated, and the model's generalization to English constituency parsing is demonstrated. The authors express excitement about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks, such as handling inputs and outputs other than text and making generation less sequential. The code used for training and evaluating the models is available on GitHub. The paper acknowledges the contributions of Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws.\n",

            "The paper introduces the Transformer, a new network architecture that relies solely on attention mechanisms for sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer model achieves superior results in machine translation tasks, is more parallelizable, and requires less training time compared to existing models. It achieves state-of-the-art results in translation quality and generalizes well to other tasks. The attention mechanism in the Transformer is based on dot-product attention, which is faster and more space-efficient compared to additive attention. The model also employs multi-head attention, allowing it to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. The Transformer uses self-attention layers in the encoder and decoder, as well as encoder-decoder attention layers. The model also includes position-wise feed-forward networks and positional encodings to capture the order of the sequence. The Transformer architecture offers a more efficient and effective approach to sequence transduction tasks compared to traditional recurrent and convolutional layers. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer can yield more interpretable models, as shown by the inspection of attention distributions. The paper also provides details on the training regime, hardware and schedule, optimizer, and regularization techniques used. The Transformer model achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on machine translation tasks, while requiring significantly less training cost. Furthermore, the Transformer architecture generalizes well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing, outperforming previous models. In conclusion, the Transformer presents a groundbreaking approach to sequence transduction tasks, offering improved performance, interpretability, and generalization capabilities. The authors are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks, such as handling large inputs and outputs like images, audio, and video. The code used to train and evaluate the models is available on GitHub. The authors acknowledge the contributions of Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws.\n",

            "Summary: George Washington (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799) was an American military officer, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Second Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted and ratified the Constitution of the United States and established the American federal government. Washington has thus been called the \"Father of his Country\".\n",
            "Washington's first public office, from 1749 to 1750, was as surveyor of Culpeper County in the Colony of Virginia. He subsequently received military training and was assigned command of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Washington led American forces to a decisive victory over the British in the Revolutionary War, leading the British to sign the Treaty of Paris, which acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States. He resigned his commission in 1783 after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War. \n",
            "Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As the first U.S. president, Washington implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry that emerged between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including use of the title \"Mr. President\" and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism in which he wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it.\n",
            "Washington has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media depictions, geographical locations including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency. He is ranked among the greatest U.S. presidents. In 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies, the highest rank in the U.S. Army. His legacy is marred, however, by his ownership of slaves and his complicated relationship with slavery, as well as his policy to assimilate Native Americans into the Anglo-American culture and waging war against Native American nations during the Revolutionary Wars and the Northwest Indian War.\n",

            "Page: George Washington Carver\n",
            "Summary: George Washington Carver (c. 1864 – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist and inventor who promoted alternative crops to cotton and methods to prevent soil depletion. He was one of the most prominent black scientists of the early 20th century.\n",
            "While a professor at Tuskegee Institute, Carver developed techniques to improve types of soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. He wanted poor farmers to grow other crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts. Although he spent years developing and promoting numerous products made from peanuts, none became commercially successful.Apart from his work to improve the lives of farmers, Carver was also a leader in promoting environmentalism. He received numerous honors for his work, including the Spingarn Medal of the NAACP. In an era of high racial polarization, his fame reached beyond the black community. He w\u001b[0m\n",
